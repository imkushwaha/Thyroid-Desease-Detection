Thyroid---- Gland ---releases -----T4 (thyroxine, contains four iodide atoms)  & T3 (triiodothyronine, contains three iodide atoms)--- helps in metabolism of body

Thyroid is supervised by something called the pituitary gland --- Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)

---The TSH will be sent to the thyroid and it will tell the thyroid  what needs to be done to get the body back to normal.


Thyroid Disease: medical condition that keeps your thyroid from making the right amount of hormones. 

(1)When the thyroid makes too much thyroid hormone, our body uses energy too quickly. This is called hyperthyroidism.
(2)When the thyroid make too little thyroid hormone. This is called hypothyroidism. 


Who is affected by thyroid disease?

Thyroid disease can affect anyone — men, women, infants, teenagers and the elderly. It can be present at birth (typically hypothyroidism) 
and it can develop as you age (often after menopause in women).


Symptoms

#### hypothyroidism

--Thyroiditis: This condition is an inflammation (swelling) of the thyroid gland. 
  Thyroiditis can lower the amount of hormones your thyroid produces.
   
   
--Hashimoto’s thyroiditis: A painless disease, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition where the body’s cells attack and damage the 
  thyroid. This is an inherited condition.
  
--Postpartum thyroiditis: This condition occurs in 5% to 9% of women after childbirth. It’s usually a temporary condition.

--Iodine deficiency: Iodine is used by the thyroid to produce hormones. An iodine deficiency is an issue that affects several million people around the world.

#### hyperthyroidism

--Graves’ disease: In this condition the entire thyroid gland might be overactive and produce too much hormone. 
  This problem is also called diffuse toxic goiter (enlarged thyroid gland).
  
-- Nodules: Hyperthyroidism can be caused by nodules that are overactive within the thyroid. 
  A single nodule is called toxic autonomously functioning thyroid nodule, while a gland with several nodules is called a toxic multi-nodular goiter.
  
--Thyroiditis: This disorder can be either painful or not felt at all. In thyroiditis, the thyroid releases hormones that were stored there. 
  This can last for a few weeks or months.

--Excessive iodine: When you have too much iodine (the mineral that is used to make thyroid hormones) in your body, the thyroid makes more thyroid hormones than it needs.
  Excessive iodine can be found in some medications (amiodarone, a heart medication) and cough syrups.
  




#### How is thyroid disease diagnosed?


---->Thyroid Blood Test: Thyroid blood tests are used to see if you have: Hyperthyroidism, Hypothyroidism.

Thyroid blood tests are used to diagnose thyroid disorders associated with hyper- or hypothyroidism. 

These include:

--Thyroiditis.
--Graves’ disease.
--Hashimoto’s disease.
--Goiter.
--Thyroid nodule.
--Thyroid cancer.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH):  Normal TSH range for an adult: 0.40 - 4.50 mIU/mL (milli-international units per liter of blood).

T4: Low T4 is seen with hypothyroidism, whereas high T4 levels may indicate hyperthyroidism. 
    Normal T4 range for an adult: 5.0 – 11.0 ug/dL (micrograms per deciliter of blood).
	
FT4(Free T4 or free thyroxine): Normal FT3 range: 2.3 - 4.1 pg/mL (picograms per milliliter of blood)


Additional blood tests might include: 1 Thyroid antibodies
                                      2 Calcitonin
									  3 Thyroglobulin
									  
									  
									  
									  
Imaging tests

In many cases, taking a look at the thyroid itself can answer a lot of questions. 
Your healthcare provider might do an imaging test called a thyroid scan. 
This allows your provider to look at your thyroid to check for an increased size, shape or growths (nodules)  
  
  
for machine learning model:


####### Data Requirement:

for making machine learning model to detect thyroid disease, we need data of people who have already gone with thyroid blood test
to know whether they are suffering from thyroid disease or not. If yes then what kind of thyroid disease they are suffering from.


we will be needing data set containing:

1)Age---> Beacuse thyroid depend on age

2)gender---> Depends on gender also, more likely to occur in female after 60 and after child birth

3)People already on thyroxine treatment or not

4)People already on antithyroid medication or not

5)pregnancy if patient is female

6)Whether person is sick at the time of diagnosis

7) Iodine test: 

8) Lithium: Lithium is concentrated by the thyroid and inhibits thyroidal iodine uptake

9) Goiter test: A goiter can sometimes occur when your thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism).

10) Tumor test: Thyroid cancer occurs when cells in your thyroid undergo genetic changes (mutations). 
               The mutations allow the cells to grow and multiply rapidly. The cells also lose the ability to die, 
			   as normal cells would. The accumulating abnormal thyroid cells form a tumor.

11) TSH level measure: It supervise thyroid gland, TSH released by pituitary gland. 
                      Normal TSH range for an adult: 0.40 - 4.50 mIU/mL (milli-international units per liter of blood).

12) T3 level measure:

13)T4 level measure: Low T4 is seen with hypothyroidism, whereas high T4 levels may indicate hyperthyroidism. 
                      Normal T4 range for an adult: 5.0 – 11.0 ug/dL (micrograms per deciliter of blood).

14) FTI(Free T4 or Free Thyroxine:  The free T4 index (FTI) is a blood test used to diagnose thyroid disorders.
                                    
                                    The FTI is obtained by multiplying the (Total T4) times (T3 Uptake) to obtain an index.
                                    
									Normal FT3 range: 2.3 - 4.1 pg/mL (picograms per milliliter of blood)
									

15) Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG): The TBG blood test measures the level of a protein that moves thyroid hormone throughout your body.
